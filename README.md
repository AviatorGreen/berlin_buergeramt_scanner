# Availability Checker with Text-to-Speech Alerts

This Python script checks the availability of appointments on a specific website and alerts the user using text-to-speech when appointments become available.

## Features

- Checks for the availability of appointments on a given website.
- Utilizes text-to-speech to notify the user of appointment availability.
- Handles errors, including HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python
- Selenium
- pyttsx3
- Mozilla Firefox (GeckoDriver) for Selenium

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install selenium pyttsx3
```

## Configuration

1. Set the URL of the website you want to monitor in the `url` variable.

2. Ensure you have the Mozilla Firefox GeckoDriver installed and set the `geckodriver_path` variable to the path of your GeckoDriver executable.

## Usage

Run the script using:

```bash
python availability_checker.py
```

The script will continuously monitor the website for appointment availability, and when appointments become available or an error occurs, it will use text-to-speech to notify the user.

## Customization

You can customize the script to suit your needs by modifying the following:

- Adjust the `backoff` and `attempt` variables to control the retry behavior.
- Customize the notification messages or handling of specific errors.
- Extend the script to perform additional actions when appointments are available.
